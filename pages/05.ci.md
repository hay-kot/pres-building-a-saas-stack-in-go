# No.

You can have unit tests when you have users

<!--
- At this point we're more concerned about how our system functions as a whole vs. how each unit functions. 
- There are of course exceptions to this when you have a pure-function with defined inputs and outputs. If it's low hanging fruit, you can have some units tests.

# Integration Tests

- Containerized workflows
- Built on Dagger.io
- Tests run against a **real** database
- Each test get's it own postgres database
- Tests can be run in parallel or isolation

## Why Integration Tests

- Serialization layer is simple I/O
- Services layer is where the bulk of our complexity lies
- Right trade-off to make for early stage project
