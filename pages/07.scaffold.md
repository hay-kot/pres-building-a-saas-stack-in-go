# The Scaffold Project

Scaffold is a project generation tool similar to cookiecutter written in Go that leverages the Go template engine to generate projects from a template. It is designed to be used with git or the local file system with a built in "scaffold" management system for versions and templates.

- Allows for in-project code generation
- Inject code into existing files
- Super-charge new entity/domain creation
- I wrote it so it must be good
