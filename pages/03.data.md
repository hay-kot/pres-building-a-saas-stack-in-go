## Postgres

<br>

### Pros

- Extremely Extensible
- Plenty of Hosted Options
- Easily locally hosted
- Gold standard for relational databases

<br>

### Cons

- Can be overkill for small projects
- Self managed backups and maintenance
- Hosted offerings get expensive quickly

## Sqlite

<img v-drag="'sqlite'"  src="/images/sqlite.webp" />

<br>

### Pros

- Extremely Lightweight
- Easy to self host (just a file)
- Avoid n+1 latency issues in most cases
- Create multiple databases for different purposes (cache, queue, etc)

<br>

### Cons

- Sqlite is _weird_
- Only one hosted solution (Turso)
- Only single writer at a time*


<span class="text-sm">

_`*` - Included for completeness, but we don't have any users so this isn't a problem, and realistically isn't a problem for MOST projects_

# Sqlite Examples

::left::

## Example 1

```sql
CREATE TABLE dnd_spells (
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    school TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```

## Example 2

```sql
CREATE TABLE dnd_spells (
    name asdfasdj NOT NULL,
    description bigserial NOT NULL,
    school pg_snaptshot NOT NULL
);
```

::right::

## Example 3

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_1(
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO example_1 (name) VALUES (1);
```

## Example 4

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_1(
  name TEXT NOT NULL
) STRICT;

INSERT INTO example_1 (name) VALUES (1);
```

# ORM vs SQL

## What is an ORM

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using object-oriented programming paradigms. It abstracts the database into a set of objects and drives the database tables through these objects.

## What We Care About

1. Generally Good Performance
2. Easy to Use
3. Easy to Maintain
4. Easy to Understand

# Notable ORM Mentions

- GORM - [https://gorm.io/docs/index.html](https://gorm.io/docs/index.html)
  - Configuration from structs
- Entgo.io - [https://entgo.io/](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-def)
  - Configuration from Go code then generates Go code

# Why We Chose SQL (SQLC)

- You have to learn SQL Eventually
- We didn't have to learn another paradigm
- SQLC Generates almost all of the "boilerplate" code for us
- Full control over SQL Migrations and execution
