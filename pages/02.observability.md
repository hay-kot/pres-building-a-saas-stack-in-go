# What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its external outputs.
What that means for us is that we can understand how our application is performing by looking at the **logs** and **traces** produced by the application.

# What is Open Telemetry?

Open Telemetry is a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to collect telemetry data from your applications. You can think if it as a standards body for defining what the data should look like and how it should be collected.

# How We're Leveraging Open Telemetry

1. Collecting Application Logs
    - Utilizing Zerolog for fast structured (JSON) logging
    - Also possible to use the standard library `slog` package
2. Collecting Application Traces
    - Using the Otel Libraries to instrument our code
    - Using a Chi Middleware to automatically instrument our HTTP handlers
3. Collection Application Metrics _(TODO!)_
    - Active Users
    - Request Latency
