# Deployment Strategy

<!--
- We haven't made much progress here in the code but I can share some ideas of what we're thinking

1. We're thinking that we will deploy this to a 5 dollar a month VPS
2. We're going to host postgres internall as a docker conatiner
3. We're going to look at infrastructure as code tools like Plumi to spin up our VPS and provision it
4. We're going to look at Ansible to handle the setup for the VPS
